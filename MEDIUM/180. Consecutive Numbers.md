| id          | int     |
| num         | varchar |

- `id` is the primary key for this table.
- `id` is an autoincrement column starting from 1.

| 4  | 2   |
| 5  | 1   |
| 6  | 2   |
| 7  | 2   |

**Output:**

| ConsecutiveNums |
|-----------------|
| 1               |

**Explanation:**

## SQL Solution

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT(l1.num) as ConsecutiveNums 
FROM Logs l1, Logs l2, Logs l3
WHERE l1.id+1=l2.id AND l1.num=l2.num AND l2.id+1=l3.id AND l2.num=l3.num
