# 585. Investments in 2016

## Problem Statement

Table: **Insurance**

| Column Name | Type  |
|-------------|-------|
| pid         | int   |
| tiv_2015    | float |
| tiv_2016    | float |
| lat         | float |
| lon         | float |

- `pid` is the **primary key** (column with unique values) for this table.
- Each row of this table contains information about one policy where:
  - `pid` is the policyholder's policy ID.
  - `tiv_2015` is the total investment value in 2015.
  - `tiv_2016` is the total investment value in 2016.
  - `lat` is the latitude of the policyholder's city (guaranteed not NULL).
  - `lon` is the longitude of the policyholder's city (guaranteed not NULL).

---

## Objective

Write a solution to report the sum of all total investment values in 2016 (`tiv_2016`), for all policyholders who:

1. Have the same `tiv_2015` value as one or more other policyholders, and
2. Are not located in the same city as any other policyholder (i.e., the `(lat, lon)` attribute pairs must be unique).

Round `tiv_2016` to two decimal places.

Return the sum in the format below.

## Example

### Input

**Insurance table:**

| pid | tiv_2015 | tiv_2016 | lat | lon |
|-----|----------|----------|-----|-----|
| 1   | 10       | 5        | 10  | 10  |
| 2   | 20       | 20       | 20  | 20  |
| 3   | 10       | 30       | 20  | 20  |
| 4   | 10       | 40       | 40  | 40  |

### Output

| tiv_2016 |
|----------|
| 45.00    |

---

### Explanation

- The first record in the table, like the last record, meets both of the two criteria:
  - The `tiv_2015` value of 10 is the same as the third and fourth records.
  - Its location is unique (lat = 10, lon = 10).
- The second record does not meet either of the criteria:
  - Its `tiv_2015` is not like any other policyholder's.
  - Its location (lat = 20, lon = 20) is the same as the third record, making the third record fail as well.
- So, the result is the sum of `tiv_2016` values from the first and last records, which is `45.00`.

## SQL Solution

```sql
SELECT ROUND(SUM(tiv_2016),2) as tiv_2016 
FROM Insurance
WHERE tiv_2015 in (
    SELECT tiv_2015 FROM Insurance
    GROUP BY tiv_2015
    HAVING COUNT(*)>1 
)
AND (lat , lon) in (
    SELECT lat,lon FROM Insurance
    GROUP BY lat,lon
    HAVING COUNT(*)=1
)
```
