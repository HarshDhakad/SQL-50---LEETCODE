# 550. Game Play Analysis IV

## Problem Statement

Table: **Activity**

| Column Name  | Type    |
|--------------|---------|
| player_id    | int     |
| device_id    | int     |
| event_date   | date    |
| games_played | int     |

`(player_id, event_date)` is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) of this table.  
This table shows the activity of players of some games. Each row is a record of a player who logged in and played a number of games (possibly 0) before logging out on some day using some device.

### Task

Write a solution to report the fraction of players that logged in again on the day after the day they first logged in, rounded to 2 decimal places. In other words, you need to count the number of players that logged in for at least two consecutive days starting from their first login date, then divide that number by the total number of players.

### Example

#### Input:
**Activity table:**

| player_id | device_id | event_date | games_played |
|-----------|-----------|------------|--------------|
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-01 | 5            |
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-02 | 6            |
| 2         | 3         | 2017-06-25 | 1            |
| 3         | 1         | 2016-03-02 | 0            |
| 3         | 4         | 2018-07-03 | 5            |

#### Output:

| fraction |
|----------|
| 0.33     |

### Explanation:
Only the player with id 1 logged back in after the first day they had logged in, so the answer is `1/3 = 0.33`.

### SQL Solution

```sql
SELECT ROUND(SUM(player_login)/COUNT(DISTINCT player_id),2) as fraction
FROM(
    SELECT player_id ,
    DATEDIFF(event_date ,min(event_date ) over(partition by player_id))=1 as player_login
    FROM Activity
) as new_table
```

## Query Breakdown:

1. **Find the first login date for each player**:
   - For each player, we find the earliest day they logged in (their "first login").
   - Then, we check if they logged in on the very next day after this first login.

2. **Calculate whether the player logged in the next day**:
   - For each login, we check if the login happened exactly one day after their first login.
   - If it did, mark it as `TRUE`, otherwise `FALSE`.

3. **Calculate the fraction of players who logged in on consecutive days**:
   - We count how many players logged in on consecutive days.
   - Then, we divide this count by the total number of players.
   - The result is rounded to two decimal places.
