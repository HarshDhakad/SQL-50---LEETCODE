## Problem Statement

Table: **Accounts**

| Column Name | Type |
|-------------|------|
| account_id  | int  |
| income      | int  |

- `account_id` is the **primary key** (column with unique values).
- Each row contains information about the **monthly income** for one bank account.

---

## Task

Calculate the number of bank accounts for each **salary category**:
- **Low Salary**: incomes **strictly less** than `$20000`
- **Average Salary**: incomes **between** `$20000` and `$50000` (inclusive)
- **High Salary**: incomes **strictly greater** than `$50000`

**Note:**
- The result must **contain all three categories**.
- If a category has **no accounts**, return `0`.

Return the result table in **any order**.

## Example

**Input:**

Accounts table:

| account_id | income |
|------------|--------|
| 3          | 108939 |
| 2          | 12747  |
| 8          | 87709  |
| 6          | 91796  |

**Output:**

| category        | accounts_count |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Low Salary      | 1               |
| Average Salary  | 0               |
| High Salary     | 3               |

**Explanation:**
- **Low Salary**: Only account 2 (income 12747).
- **Average Salary**: No accounts.
- **High Salary**: Accounts 3, 6, and 8 (income 108939, 91796, 87709).
