# 176. Second Highest Salary

## Problem Statement

Table: **Employee**

| Column Name | Type |
|-------------|------|
| id          | int  |
| salary      | int  |

- `id` is the primary key (column with unique values).
- Each row contains information about an employee's salary.

## Task

Write a solution to find the **second highest distinct salary** from the `Employee` table.  
If there is **no second highest salary**, return `null` (or `None` in Pandas).

The result format is:

| SecondHighestSalary |
|---------------------|
| value or null        |

## Example 1

**Input**:

Employee table:

| id | salary |
|----|--------|
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |

**Output**:

| SecondHighestSalary |
|---------------------|
| 200                 |

---

## Example 2

**Input**:

Employee table:

| id | salary |
|----|--------|
| 1  | 100    |

**Output**:

| SecondHighestSalary |
|---------------------|
| null                |

## SQL Solution

```sql
SELECT MAX(salary) as SecondHighestSalary FROM Employee
WHERE salary not in (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM Employee)
```
