## Problem Statement

Table: **Products**

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| product_id  | int     |
| new_price   | int     |
| change_date | date    |

- `(product_id, change_date)` is the **primary key** (combination of columns with unique values).
- Each row indicates that the price of a product was changed to a **new price** at a specific **date**.

---

## Task

Find the prices of all products **on 2019-08-16**.
- **Assume** the price of all products **before any change** is **10**.

Return the result table in **any order**.

## Example

**Input:**

Products table:

| product_id | new_price | change_date |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| 1          | 20        | 2019-08-14   |
| 2          | 50        | 2019-08-14   |
| 1          | 30        | 2019-08-15   |
| 1          | 35        | 2019-08-16   |
| 2          | 65        | 2019-08-17   |
| 3          | 20        | 2019-08-18   |

**Output:**

| product_id | price |
|------------|-------|
| 2          | 50    |
| 1          | 35    |
| 3          | 10    |

**Explanation:**

- Product 1:
  - Changed to 20 on 2019-08-14
  - Then 30 on 2019-08-15
  - Then 35 on 2019-08-16 → **Price on 2019-08-16 is 35**

- Product 2:
  - Changed to 50 on 2019-08-14
  - Changed again to 65 on 2019-08-17 → **So on 2019-08-16, still 50**

- Product 3:
  - No changes until 2019-08-18 → **Price remains 10**

## SQL Solution

```sql
SELECT product_id,new_price as price FROM Products
WHERE (product_id,change_date) in 
(SELECT product_id, MAX(change_date)
FROM Products
WHERE change_date<='2019-08-16'
GROUP BY product_id)

UNION

SELECT product_id,10 as price FROM Products
WHERE (product_id) not in 
(SELECT product_id
FROM Products
WHERE change_date<='2019-08-16'
GROUP BY product_id)
```
