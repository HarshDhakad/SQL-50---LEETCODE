# 626. Exchange Seats

## Problem Statement

Table: **Seat**

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| id          | int     |
| student     | varchar |

- `id` is the **primary key**.
- The `id` values start from 1 and increase by 1.
- You are asked to **swap every two consecutive students**.
- If there is an **odd number of students**, the last one remains in the same position.

---

## Objective

Swap the seat (id) of every two students. Return the result **ordered by id**.

---

## Example

### Input

**Seat table:**

| id | student |
|----|---------|
| 1  | Abbot   |
| 2  | Doris   |
| 3  | Emerson |
| 4  | Green   |
| 5  | Jeames  |

---

### Output

| id | student |
|----|---------|
| 1  | Doris   |
| 2  | Abbot   |
| 3  | Green   |
| 4  | Emerson |
| 5  | Jeames  |

---

### Explanation

- **(1, 2)** → Doris ↔ Abbot
- **(3, 4)** → Green ↔ Emerson
- **5** remains unchanged (odd number of students)

---

## SQL Solution

```sql
SELECT 
CASE
WHEN id=(SELECT MAX(id) FROM Seat) AND id % 2=1 THEN id 
WHEN id % 2=1 THEN id+1 ELSE id-1 END as id 
, student
FROM Seat
ORDER BY id
```
