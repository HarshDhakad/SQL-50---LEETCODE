| Sales      | Henry    | 80000  |
| Sales      | Sam      | 60000  |

  - **Joe** and **Randy** share the second-highest salary.
  - **Will** has the third-highest salary.

- In the **Sales** department:
  - **Henry** earns the highest salary.
  - **Sam** has the second-highest salary, and there is no third-highest salary since there are only two employees.

### SQL Solution:

```sql
SELECT Department,Employee,Salary 
FROM(
    SELECT d.name as  Department , e.name as Employee ,e.salary as Salary ,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY d.id ORDER BY e.salary DESC) as ranks
    FROM Employee e INNER JOIN Department d
    ON e.departmentId =d.id
) as temp
WHERE ranks<=3
```

---
## Explanation:

- RankedSalaries: We use the DENSE_RANK() window function to rank employees by their salary within each department. DENSE_RANK() ensures that employees with the same salary receive the same rank, allowing for multiple employees to share the same rank if their salary is identical.

- PARTITION BY: This clause partitions the ranking by the departmentId, meaning the ranking will reset for each department.

- ORDER BY: The salaries are ordered in descending order so that the highest salary gets the top rank.

- WHERE: We filter out only the top 3 salaries (those with ranks 1, 2, 3).
