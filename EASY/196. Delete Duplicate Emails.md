**Difficulty:** Easy

---

## ðŸ§¾ Table

### Person

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| id          | int     |
| email       | varchar |

- `id` is the **primary key**.
- Each row contains an email.
- Emails **will not contain uppercase letters**.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Task

Write a solution to **delete all duplicate emails**, keeping **only one unique email with the smallest id**.

- **SQL users**: Write a `DELETE` statement.
- **Pandas users**: Modify the `Person` DataFrame **in-place**.

## ðŸ“¥ Example

### Input

**Person Table:**

| id | email             |
|----|-------------------|
| 1  | john@example.com  |
| 2  | bob@example.com   |
| 3  | john@example.com  |

---

### Output

| id | email             |
|----|-------------------|
| 1  | john@example.com  |
| 2  | bob@example.com   |

---

## âœ… SQL Solution
```sql
DELETE p1
FROM Person p1
INNER JOIN Person p2
ON p1.email = p2.email AND p1.id > p2.id;
```
```sql
DELETE p1
FROM Person p1 , Person p2
WHERE p1.email=p2.email and p1.id>p2.id
```

---
## ðŸ“Œ Explanation
- We join the table with itself based on the same email.

- If p1.id > p2.id, it means p1 is a duplicate with a larger id, so we delete it.

- This keeps the record with the smallest id for each email.
