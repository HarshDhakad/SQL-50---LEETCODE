# ðŸ§ª SQL Problem 584: Find Customer Referee

## ðŸ“˜ Table: `Customer`

```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
| referee_id  | int     |
+-------------+---------+
```

- `id` is the **primary key** (unique for each customer).
- Each row indicates:
  - the `id` of a customer
  - their `name`
  - the `id` of the customer who referred them (`referee_id`).

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Task

Write a SQL query to **find the names of customers who were *not referred* by the customer with id = 2**.

Return the result table **in any order**.

---

## ðŸ“¥ Example Input

**Customer Table**

```
+----+------+------------+
| id | name | referee_id |
+----+------+------------+
| 1  | Will | null       |
| 2  | Jane | null       |
| 3  | Alex | 2          |
| 4  | Bill | null       |
| 5  | Zack | 1          |
| 6  | Mark | 2          |
+----+------+------------+
```

---

## ðŸ“¤ Example Output

```
+------+
| name |
+------+
| Will |
| Jane |
| Bill |
| Zack |
+------+
```

---

## ðŸ’¡ Explanation

- Customers `Alex` and `Mark` were referred by customer with `id = 2`.
- So we exclude them.
- The remaining customers: **Will, Jane, Bill, Zack** are included in the output.

---

## âœ… SQL Solution

```sql
SELECT name
FROM Customer
WHERE referee_id != 2 OR referee_id IS NULL;
```
