# 1978. Employees Whose Manager Left the Company

## Problem Statement

You are given a table `Employees`:

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| employee_id | int     |
| name        | varchar |
| manager_id  | int     |
| salary      | int     |

- `employee_id` is the primary key.
- Each employee may or may not have a manager (`manager_id` can be `NULL`).
- If a manager leaves, their record is removed, but their `manager_id` may still appear in the table.

---

## Goal

Find all **employees** who:
- Have a **salary < 30000**
- Have a `manager_id` that **does not exist** in the `employee_id` list (i.e., manager left)

Return the result sorted by `employee_id`.

## Example

### Input

**Employees Table**:

| employee_id | name      | manager_id | salary |
|-------------|-----------|------------|--------|
| 3           | Mila      | 9          | 60301  |
| 12          | Antonella | NULL       | 31000  |
| 13          | Emery     | NULL       | 67084  |
| 1           | Kalel     | 11         | 21241  |
| 9           | Mikaela   | NULL       | 50937  |
| 11          | Joziah    | 6          | 28485  |

---

### Output

| employee_id |
|-------------|
| 11          |

---

## SQL Solution

```sql
SELECT employee_id FROM Employees
WHERE manager_id NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT(employee_id) FROM Employees)
AND salary<30000
ORDER BY employee_id;
```
