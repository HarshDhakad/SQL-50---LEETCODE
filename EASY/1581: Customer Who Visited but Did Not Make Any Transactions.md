# ðŸ‘¥ SQL Problem 1581: Customer Who Visited but Did Not Make Any Transactions

## ðŸ“˜ Table 1: `Visits`

```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| visit_id    | int     |
| customer_id | int     |
+-------------+---------+

| amount         | int     |
+----------------+---------+
```

- Each row is a **purchase** made during a `visit_id`.
- One visit can have **multiple transactions**, or none at all.

- The IDs of **customers who visited the mall** but **did NOT make any transactions**.
- Count **how many such visits** were made by each customer.

**Visits**

```

| visit_id | customer_id |
+----------+-------------+
| 1        | 23          |
| 2        | 9           |
| 4        | 30          |

**Transactions**

```
+----------------+----------+--------+
| transaction_id | visit_id | amount |
+----------------+----------+--------+
| 2              | 5        | 310    |
| 3              | 5        | 300    |
| 9              | 5        | 200    |
| 12             | 1        | 910    |
| 13             | 2        | 970    |
+----------------+----------+--------+
```

---

## ðŸ“¤ Example Output

```
+-------------+----------------+
| customer_id | count_no_trans |
+-------------+----------------+
| 54          | 2              |
| 30          | 1              |
| 96          | 1              |
+-------------+----------------+
```

---

## âœ… SQL Solution

```sql
SELECT 
    v.customer_id,
    COUNT(*) AS count_no_trans
FROM Visits v
LEFT JOIN Transactions t 
    ON v.visit_id = t.visit_id
WHERE t.transaction_id IS NULL
GROUP BY v.customer_id;
```

---

## ðŸ’¬ Explanation

- We use a `LEFT JOIN` to keep **all visits**, and bring in transaction data if present.
- For visits **without any transactions**, the `transaction_id` will be `NULL`.
- We filter out only those rows using `WHERE t.transaction_id IS NULL`.
- Finally, we **group by `customer_id`** and **count** how many such visits they had.
