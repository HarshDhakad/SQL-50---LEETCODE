## âœ… SQL Solution

```sql
SELECT e.name, b.bonus 
FROM Employee e LEFT JOIN Bonus b 
ON e.empId= b.empId
WHERE b.bonus IS NULL OR b.bonus < 1000;

```

---

## ðŸ’¬ Explanation

- ðŸ”— LEFT JOIN is used to get all employees â€” even those without any bonus record.

-ðŸ§® We use a WHERE clause to filter:

- - b.bonus IS NULL: Employee didnâ€™t get any bonus.

- - b.bonus < 1000: Employee got a bonus, but it's less than 1000.

ðŸŽ¯ The final result shows the name and bonus amount of only those employees.
