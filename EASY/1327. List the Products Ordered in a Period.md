### SQL Schema

#### Products Table:
| Column Name      | Type    |
|------------------|---------|
| product_id       | int     |
| product_name     | varchar |
| product_category | varchar |

- `product_id` is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
- This table contains data about the company's products.

|---------------|---------|
| product_id    | int     |
| order_date    | date    |

- `product_id` is a foreign key (reference column) to the Products table.
- `unit` is the number of products ordered in `order_date`.

### Example Output

| product_name       | unit |
|--------------------|------|
| Leetcode Solutions | 130  |
| Leetcode Kit       | 100  |

### Explanation

- Products with `product_id = 1` were ordered in February with a total of `(60 + 70) = 130` units.
- Products with `product_id = 2` were ordered in February with a total of 80 units.
- Products with `product_id = 3` were ordered in February with a total of `(2 + 3) = 5` units.
- Products with `product_id = 4` were not ordered in February 2020.
- Products with `product_id = 5` were ordered in February with a total of `(50 + 50) = 100` units.

### SQL Query Solution:

```sql
SELECT product_name,SUM(unit) as unit 
FROM Products JOIN Orders ON Products.product_id = Orders.product_id  
WHERE YEAR(order_date)=2020 and MONTH(order_date)=2
GROUP BY product_name
HAVING SUM(unit)>=100 
```
